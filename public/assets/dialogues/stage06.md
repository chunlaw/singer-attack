His army is unbeatable, we are running out of weapons for defence.

### President Cress

Hey, hey, hey. We don't want to kill anyone, we just want to liberate Euthica peacefully. We could sign a Peace Treaty to safeguard your people to rule your place.

The Dual Vector Foil has already destroyed us, my responsibility is to keep everyone's life and property.
